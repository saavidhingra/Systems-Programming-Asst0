In the process of testing our code, we ran into several bugs which consisted of:

- If the first number is negative it won't work. Gotta fix
- NEED to print out error for empty file (FIXED)
- Free every malloc variable and check every malloc call for NULL
- Format the output to match description
- Need to implemelent error check for incorrect file path name given (FIXED)
- We ran into a problem where a 0 kept printing out
